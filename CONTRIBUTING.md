# Contributing

Thanks for contributing to Open Source Contribution Atelier.

## Principles

- Keep contributions beginner-friendly and well-documented
- Prefer safe defaults and avoid introducing secrets into code
- Add tests for backend and frontend changes when practical
- Discuss large architectural changes before implementation
## Onboarding Tasks

To help you get started with your first contribution, we have curated a list of 8 small, self-contained onboarding tasks across the frontend and backend. These are excellent beginner-friendly entry points:

- [ ] [Document Google OAuth setup for local development](.github/issues/005-fix-google-oauth-docs.md) — *Docs & Setup*
- [ ] [Harden CI: add lint, tests, and preview build](.github/issues/006-add-ci-workflow.md) — *Infrastructure & CI*
- [ ] [Add example lessons and exercises for new contributors](.github/issues/007-add-examples-lessons.md) — *Backend & Content*
- [ ] [Improve tests and coverage](.github/issues/008-improve-tests-and-coverage.md) — *Tests & Quality*
- [ ] [Perform accessibility audit and fixes](.github/issues/009-accessibility-audit.md) — *Frontend & Accessibility*
- [ ] [Add deployment and hosting guide](.github/issues/010-add-deployment-docs.md) — *Docs & Infrastructure*
- [ ] [Create mentorship list and assignment flow](.github/issues/011-create-mentorship-list.md) — *Community & Process*
- [ ] [Easy UI polish tasks for new contributors](.github/issues/012-easy-ui-polish.md) — *Frontend & UI*

## Setup

Use the instructions in [README.md](README.md) to run the project locally.

## Branching

- Never commit directly to `main`
- Start every change by creating a new branch from `main`
- Use branch names such as `feature/terminal-feedback`, `fix/auth-tests`, or `docs/setup-guide`
- Use clear commit messages
- Open focused pull requests

Recommended commands:

```bash
git pull origin main
git switch -c feature/short-description
```

## Pull Requests

- Describe the problem and the chosen approach
- Include screenshots for UI changes
- Mention any schema or environment updates
- Confirm tests run locally
- Push your branch and open the PR from that branch into `main`

## Code Style

- Python: Black-compatible formatting, modular Django apps
- TypeScript: ESLint + Prettier, accessible React components
- Avoid large unrelated refactors in feature PRs

## Security

- Never commit `.env` files or tokens
- Do not add code that executes untrusted shell input
- Route exercise validation through the sandbox verifier service
- Do not commit generated artifacts such as `node_modules/`, `dist/`, or local virtual environments

## Lesson Contributions & Issues

- To propose a new lesson or exercise, open an issue titled `lesson: <short title>` and include:
	- a short summary, learning objectives, and the expected exercise command(s)
	- suggested order/placement in the track
	- any files or assets required
- If you want to work on the lesson yourself, comment on the issue and open a branch prefixed with `lesson/`.
- Use `python manage.py seed_lessons` to load the example lessons locally; maintainers will review and promote community-submitted lessons.

## Issue Hygiene For Maintainers

- Keep issue labels consistent: `bug`, `enhancement`, `curriculum`, `good first issue`, `needs-triage`, `blocked`.
- Close duplicate/outdated issues with a short reason and a pointer to the active issue.
- Convert vague issues into actionable tasks by adding scope and acceptance criteria.
- If an issue is stale for >30 days with no owner, either re-scope or close it with a reopen note.
